    <p>My name is Raymond Fisher, I am a high school student looking for work involving what I enjoy practicing the most, which is computer repair including both mechanical and system maintenance.</p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I have been around Windows for as long as I can remember, looking through and manipulating file systems, directories and directory content.  As of the past few months, I have moved most of my host operating systems to Linux distributions. I am becoming increasingly avid in using the Linux platform as well as a multitude of different distributions including Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, briefly Solus and recently, Fedora.</p>
    <p>Four times in the past two years, I have built my own PC and helped someone else build their own computer unit. Thermal paste needs to be spread evenly over the CPU, studs need to be in before the motherboard, ensure all components are installed before working on cable management, be careful not to bend CPU prongs are a few examples of assembly techniques I have picked up</p>
    <p>I am always happy to volunteer for some extra work if I possess time. If there are any projects taking place at my school, I always make sure I allocate time to help them get finished. For some time, I worked with the head of the tech department at my old school, helping erase and document Macintosh units for recycling. Recently, I have been working to boot Windows 95 on a 1995 Hewlett Packard at my school for the sake of curiosity.  My friends and I are collaborating on a PC build. We are working to build a mid to high range computer consisting of an i7 CPU and GTX 1060 Graphics Processing Unit.</p>
    <p>Other than the few pieces of code I have managed to pick up from Southwest Technology College, There is not much else I have to speak of. My goal is the same as it is with any other activity: to observe, experiment, make mistakes, learn and adapt.</p>
